22,1,i've owned 6 or 7 dvd players since 
23,0,bad
11,0,troubleshooting ad-2500 and ad-2600 no picture scrolling b/w.
12,0,repost from january 13 2004 with a better fit title.
13,0,does your apex dvd player only play dvd audio without video?
14,0,does not play audio
16,0,no picture:  hopefully you still have the remote control.
17,0,if you tossed it out the window you need to fetch it.
18,1,using the remote control press the i/p button located on the bottom right corner of the remote.
19,1,the i/p button switches the tv display between interlace and progressive.
110,0,if this doesnt bring back the picture try pressing this button without playing a dvd.
111,0,if you dont get video back now you can run the player over with your car!
112,0,picture scrolling in b/w:  you need the remote control for this so you better get it from your dog before he burries it in the backyard.
113,1,press the p/n button located on the bottom right corner of the remote.
114,1,the p/n button switches your dvd players video output signal between pal and ntsc.
115,1,by pressing p/n you should be able to get a good picture on the screen.
116,1,for other problems go to i hope i have helped you continue to enjoy the apex dvd player with these troubleshooting tips.
117,0,i have done some research and experimenting with the remote when my apex ad-2500 seemed to have lost its video signal.
118,1,im a more happier person after discovering the i/p button!
119,0,the button was probably accidentally pushed to cause the black screen in the first place.
120,1,but if you're looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player i love it!
121,1,it practically plays almost everything you give it.
122,1,i've had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor.
123,1,for the price it is a well spent investment!
124,1,i would recommend buying one.
21,1,incredibe price / performance.
